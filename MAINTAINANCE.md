# How to continue work on this application

First come to a deep understanding of how the server.js file as described in the README.md file, this file almost entirely represents my workflow regarding this application. When making new HTML pages use the template provided in the "page_source" directory. I have also aimed to do a lot of my styling based on the file "non_specific_styling.css", this means that a lot of the stylig is reusable making application maintainence easier. To allow for continuation of the app I have made a git-hub repo, this allows an easy workflow, with all data stored on the cloud for backup purposes.
