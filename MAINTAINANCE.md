# How to continue work on this application

First come to a deep understanding of how the server.js file as described in the README.md file, this file almost entirely represents my workflow regarding this application. When making new HTML pages use the template provided in the "page_source" directory. I have also aimed to do a lot of my styling based on the file "non_specific_styling.css", this means that a lot of the styling is reusable making application maintainence easier, this styling file is imported to every HTML page in the app. To allow for continuation of the app I have made a public git-hub repo (made public 21/05/2021), this allows an easy workflow, with all data stored on the cloud for backup purposes.
